 - Not just a slam dunk - needs foundational readiness
 - Paradigm shift - typical team structures don't work well, need the right mix to get things done quickly and not spin the wheels

 - Various strategies to go from current state architecture to target state - you've seen a couple of choices
  - we will work with you, whatever strategy you choose, but if you ask us, we would say follow a disciplined approach
     - API first

     - Only then start to iterate the process and start moving full shift onto microservices across the board.  


- "One team" culture - where information is shared and everyone participates in healthy conversations
